  ##Get started

  The simplest way to use Pleeease is to use [CLI](/docs/#cli) (command-line interface) and a [configuration file](/docs/#configuration-file).

  Note that if you already have an advanced workflow, you can learn [how to improve it](/workflow).

  **To use CLI:** First, you have to install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) that usually comes with `npm`, its module manager. Then, install `pleeease-cli` globally on your system:

  ```javascript
  $ npm install -g pleeease-cli
  ```

  <div class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Pleeease < 3.0.0 users, you have to uninstall `pleeeease` first, then install `pleeease-cli`.</div>

  You're now ready to learn [how to use it](#how-it-simply-works).
