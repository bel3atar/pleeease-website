##CLI

<div class="note"><strong>Note :</strong> From 3.0.0, CLI tool has is own package, and Pleeease no longer contains CLI tool.</div>

With the `pleeease-cli` package, you can compile files or watch them! The two commands work with a [configuration file](#configuration-file).

###compile

```javascript
$ pleeease compile
```

###watch

```javascript
$ pleeease watch
```
Same as `compile`, except that the live compilation is activated. When a modification is detected, **files will be recompiled automatically**.

###help

```javascript
$ pleeease
```
